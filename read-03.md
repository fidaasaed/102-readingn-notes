 # There are three types of HTML lists:
* ordered list
* unordered list
* definition list

*to numbering the list in numbers and be more easy to understand*

**what is the different between order ; unorder and defintion list ?**
*Ordered lists use numbers but Unordered lists use bullets and Definition lists are used to define terminology*
**for example the shpe of unorder list is :**
<ul>

  <li> statement </li>
  <li> statement </li>
  <li> statement </li>

### basic js instruction:
 *A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipt and contain very precise instructions* 
 **For example:** 
you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
*what is the function of variables ?*
they are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
so JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
