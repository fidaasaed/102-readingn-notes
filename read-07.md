**Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model
that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.**

*what is the  tips to follow when building your own domain models?*
* Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
* Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
* Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
* Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
* Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
