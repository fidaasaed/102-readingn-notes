# Forms
*The best known form on the web is probably the search box that sits right in the middle of Google's homepag*
*Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a form element.*
Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.
and HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms

**what is the label element ?**
*When introducing form controls, the code was kept simple by indicating the purpose of each 
one in text next to it.* 

each form control should have its own <label> element as this makes the form accessible to vision-impaired users.
 **what is The <label> element can be used in two ways?** 
* Wrap around both the text description and the form input (as shown on the first line of the example to your right).
* Be kept separate from the form control and use the forattribute to indicate which form control it is a label for (as shown with the radio butt)

## tables and formsIn addition to the CSS properties covered in other 
**chapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to 
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.**
List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.

**why do we use the Table cells ?**
*it can have different borders and spacing in 
different browsers*
**why do we use the properties ?**
*use to control them and make them more consistent.*
 Forms are easier to use if the form controls are 
vertically aligned using CSS. Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more 
interactive
