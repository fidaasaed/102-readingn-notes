# Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming
**What is the hardest thing about writing code?**

* Learning a new technology
* Naming things
* Testing your code
* Debugging
* Fixing bugs
* Making software maintainable

*why the puzzles like this one are so hard?*
is because you can’t really see what you are trying to build very clearly. 

The real world is a messy place.  Many of the problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand and look completely different depending on your viewpoint.

As programmers, we also are often not given complete information about the problem domain, so we don’t even have the information we need to understand it.
f understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier,* you can do one of two things*:

* Make the problem domain easier
* Get better at understanding the problem domain
