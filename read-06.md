# Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming
**What is the hardest thing about writing code?**

* Learning a new technology
* Naming things
* Testing your code
* Debugging
* Fixing bugs
* Making software maintainable

*why the puzzles like this one are so hard?*
is because you can’t really see what you are trying to build very clearly. 

The real world is a messy place.  Many of the problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand and look completely different depending on your viewpoint.

As programmers, we also are often not given complete information about the problem domain, so we don’t even have the information we need to understand it.
f understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier,* you can do one of two things*:

* Make the problem domain easier
* Get better at understanding the problem domain

*Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.* 
Functions take the parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.

what are  the name of variables ?properties of the object 
what are the functions  known  ? methods of the object

also Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets

**The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used 
within that function.**
**wtat is the differece between the local and global var?**
* LOCAL VARIABLES 
When a variable is created inside a function using the var keyword, it can only be used in that function. It is called a local variable or function-level variable.
It is saidtohave local scope or function-level scope.
* GLOBAL VARIABLES 
If you create a variable outside of a function, then it can be used anywhere within the script. It is called a global variable and has global scope

### Document Object Mode
*DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.*
*You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.*
Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadel i st.

An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other. 
In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
