## JS Debugging

**What is the Debugging?**

*Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.*

**how can you try to find the exact error?**

*The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located.*

If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements. 
Use them to give your users helpful feedback.

*If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error 
in your code.*
