* You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is
   very helpful when you use the same sized 
images on several pages of your site.
* Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.
* You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page. 
* Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.
* You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
* To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.
